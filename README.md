### The Tech
The frontend is built with React Native.

The backend leverages a machine learning model trained by Microsoft, able to classify over 5000 plant and animal species. We deployed this model through an API written with Flask and hosted it on FloydHub, a platform for serving big deep learning models. This API also communicates with a MongoDB database
